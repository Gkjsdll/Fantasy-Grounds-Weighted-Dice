# Weighted Dice

## Description
This Fantasy Grounds extension allows the Host to override the next roll made by themselves or a player.

## Installation
Download a release, then follow the [offical extension installation instructions](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/wiki/index.php/Data_Files_Overview#Extensions).

## Developer Utilities
This project includes typescript code which makes helps to automate some of the development process. To use them, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (I recommend using [Node Version Switcher](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs) to install node).

After installing Node.js, run `npm install` or `npm i` to download the dependencies the developer utilites rely on, then run `npm run` to see a list of available utilities.
